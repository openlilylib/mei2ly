mei2ly
======

This repository was created as a stub to provide a development platform
for tools interfacing [MEI](http://music-encoding.org) and [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org)

The main goals are to implement:

- `mei2ly`  
  conversion from the MEI encoding format to LilyPond input format.  
  Possibly with the ultimate goal of having LilyPond read MEI files directly.
- `ly2mei`
  conversion from LilyPond input to MEI encoding.
- possibly a 'live' two-way conversion in the framework of the [Frescobaldi](http://frescobaldi.org) application
  and maybe extend Frescobaldi to be a powerful MEI editing platform.
- a "MEI/LilyPond broker" as described in [this post](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/pipermail/mei-l/2014/001308.html)
  in [this thread](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/pipermail/mei-l/2014/001290.html).

If you are interested in the topic you can post a message to the 
[MEI-L](https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-l) or the

ul@openlilylib.org.

Development is not done within this repository but in the [Frescobaldi](https://github.com/wbsoft/frescboaldi)
and [python-ly](https://github.com/wbsoft/python-ly) projects.
